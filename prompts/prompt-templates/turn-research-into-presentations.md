## Template Prompt

I'm uploading our {RESEARCH_TYPE|group paper,thesis,study,report} on {RESEARCH_TOPIC}. We have {DURATION} minutes to present to a {AUDIENCE_TYPE|mixed audience of professors and students,academic conference,department seminar,general audience}, with {NUMBER_OF_PRESENTERS} presenters sharing the time.

Analyze this research to:

1. **Extract Key Findings**: Identify the {NUMBER_OF_FINDINGS|3-4,5-7,2-3} most compelling findings that will resonate with our audience
2. **Create Narrative Flow**: Build a logical narrative that flows from {STRUCTURE|problem to insights to implications,background to methods to results,question to findings to impact}
3. **Design Visuals**: Create {SLIDE_COUNT} slides that simplify complex data without losing accuracy

**Presentation Requirements:**
- Target audience level: {EXPERTISE_LEVEL|Mixed expertise,Expert,Beginner-friendly}
- Emphasis on {FOCUS|Data visualization,Methodology,Practical applications,Theoretical implications}
- Include {MATERIALS|Speaker notes,Slide deck outline,Talking points,Q&A preparation}

**Design Specifications:**
- Visual style: {STYLE|Academic formal,Modern minimal,Data-focused,Storytelling-driven}
- Chart types: {CHART_PREFERENCES|Bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots,Infographics,Tables}
- Slide platform: {PLATFORM|Canva,PowerPoint,Google Slides,Keynote}

## Use Case Description

This template transforms academic research into presentation materials by identifying key findings, structuring them into a cohesive narrative arc, and generating both slide deck outlines and speaker notes. The approach emphasizes extracting compelling themes and translating them into materials suited for specific audiences and time constraints.
