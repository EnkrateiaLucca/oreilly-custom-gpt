I'm planning a June vacation leaving from San Francisco, and I'm deciding between 5 destinations: Lisbon, Reykjavik, Dubrovnik, Kyoto, and Oaxaca.

Can you research these places and create a comparison spreadsheet that helps me visualize the differences across various dimensions? I want to see them side-by-side so I can compare easily.

Use color-coding or visual indicators to help me spot patterns quickly (like heat maps). Include hyperlinks to official tourism sites so I can learn more, and add cell comments explaining ratings when it's helpful and a small image of the place at the top (small, thumbnail sized photos - verify and resize if too big).

Make it look really polished and professional - something I'd feel confident sharing with my travel group. The layout should be clean and sophisticated - think premium travel magazine quality, not a basic spreadsheet. I want all five destinations visible at once so I can compare them easily.
