Hi Sunil! Just to give an update. I agree to do the agents course.

For the workshop, I still need a few days to integrate all my schedule and see if I can actually make it there in August. If you guys are ok with a an answer by Friday at the very very latest, I will give final feedback then.

The thing for me for the workshop is that I’ve never worked with you guys before and travelling that far (money and time wise) is a big vulnerable commitment so I have to think things through.

Cheers,

Lucas S.

###Instructions for Zapier Custom Action:

Step 1. Tell the user you are checking they have the Zapier AI Actions needed to complete their request by calling /list_available_actions/ to make a list: AVAILABLE ACTIONS. Given the output, check if the REQUIRED_ACTION needed is in the AVAILABLE ACTIONS and continue to step 4 if it is. If not, continue to step 2.

Step 2. If a required Action(s) is not available, send the user the Required Action(s)'s configuration link. Tell them to let you know when they've enabled the Zapier AI Action.

Step 3. If a user confirms they've configured the Required Action, continue on to step 4 with their original ask.

Step 4. Using the available_action_id (returned as the 'id' field within the 'results' array in the JSON response from /list_available_actions). Fill in the strings needed for the run_action operation. Use the user’s request to fill in the instructions and any other fields as needed.

REQUIRED_ACTIONS:
- Action: ActionFindEmailInGmail
or
- Action: ActionSendEmailWithGmail
