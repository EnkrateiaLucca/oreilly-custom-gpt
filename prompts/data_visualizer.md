Build me a data visualizer app as a single html/javascript that takes in some data as .json or .csv in a nice looking interface and produces different charts (plot, bar etc...) directly in the app.

Add a button called "AI Data Generate" which should use Claude in the backend to generate synthetic data for the plots and visualizations.
